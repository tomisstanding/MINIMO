Dear applicant,

Thank your for applying for the Front-end Developer role at Specific Assembly. Below you will find
the files necessary to complete a code test put together by our engineering team. In the .zip file,
we have included a design.png file for the overall website look and additional .png assets for
creating the site. The required fonts can be found at https://fonts.google.com/. Here's the
breakdown of fonts used:

Logo/Title: "Inconsolata Regular", 30pt 
Navigation Links: "Playfair Display Regular", 14pt 
Post Category: "Ubuntu Light", 14pt 
Post Title: "Playfair Display Regular", 30pt 
Post Content: "Playfair Display Regular", 14pt 
Post Comment: "Ubuntu Light", 14pt

You can approximate the colors. Please implement the site using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The links
don't have to work, but please include hover states. Please ensure that the site is fully responsive
from Desktop down to 320px width Mobile. Responsive design treatment will be left to your discretion
save for details listed below.

Desktop width should accommodate two columns for secondary posts as shown in the design.png. For
mobile widths, the posts should rearrange into a single column. All secondary post images should be
uniform in size. The featured post image should scale to 100% of the width of the browser until a
browser width of 1200px. Past 1200px, please center this image and include whitespace. The content
of the site should not exceed 1200px.

Please complete the test by Wednesday, March 29th. Submit your code as a link to a GitHub
repository. Please include a live deployed link for viewing the final results. Thank you!
